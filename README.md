### Project Title

Transforming knowledge through open science

![NASA](https://axios.jusblog.com/assets/share/pitch/4.png?)

### High-Level Project Summary

When we realized the need to teach technology through art, we used a nasa api that allows the identification of constellations, and we adhered to its use in the arts doing constellations searches on it too, where information and mythologies are explained in a scientific way.

### Detailed Project Description

Our project consists of a WebApp that through an API imposed by NASA, in which we use its function of finding constellations, used in photographs and other artistic manifestations to determine how certain cultures see astronomy both through historical and mythological manifestations. With this, we will have an interaction platform.

### Hackathon Journey üöÄ

As a whole it became a special experience, because through it we had the opportunity to develop projects with incredible people with unique talents. We have the feeling that despite the effort made in favor of the project, we managed to validate something beautiful, which, in addition to great power, teaches us to be calm and patient.
